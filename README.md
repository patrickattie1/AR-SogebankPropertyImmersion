# AR-Sogebank Immersive property visit, Port au Prince, December 2018
Created for the innovation competition at Sogebank in Port au Prince, Ha√Øti, December 2018

This AR application was designed using Unity 2018.2.11f1 and the Vuforia Engine v7.2.23.

It was built for the Android platform. I used work explained while taking a course and customized it for my own purpose.

An attempt to use voice recognition (with http://wit.ai) has been made, but more work needs to be done to make it really usable.

The images used as examples are from public web sites as I did have neither the time nor the ressources to access Haitian properties and take decent photos from them that I could finally use as image targets.

It works as follows:

1- The user will select one of the properties' thumbnails that are displayed on the start screen 

2- Once the user has made a selection, 3 choices of image targets (in directory "\Assets\TargetImages") will be presented to him/her:
(we will assume the user selected "House1")

Choice 1 - Image target 1 (House11.jpg): the augmentation here is an introduction video will be displayed over the image target.

Choice 2 - Image target 2 (House12.jpg): the augmentation here is a 3D plan of the house showing 3 virtual buttons. 
The user will use virtual buttons to add/remove the roof, add/remove the second floor, show the view by day/night.

Choice 3 - Image target 3 (House13.jpg): the augmentation here is a navigable tour of the inside of the house using the touch screen on the Android device.

For more information, look inside the wiki or email patrick.attie@esih.edu

The photos can be found in the "Assets\TargetImages" directory  (size~7Mb).
